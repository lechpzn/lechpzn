Hi, I'm Afonso Souza!

## 🔍 What I Do

At Celer Network, I'm part of the team working on decentralized interoperability infrastructure. My primary focus is on **ZK circuits and proof systems** to ensure secure and verifiable **cross-chain messaging** and **state validation**.

### 🧩 My Responsibilities

- ✨ Design and implement efficient zkSNARK circuits using `gnark`.
- ⚡ Optimize prover performance and circuit constraints for production deployment.
- 🔁 Work on recursive proof composition for verifying multi-hop messaging.
- 🔐 Contribute to cross-chain verification logic using PLONK and BN254-based proofs.
- 🧪 Build reproducible test frameworks and performance benchmarks.
- 🧰 Integrate circuits into the cross-chain communication stack (Go backend).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Go, Rust (some bindings), Solidity (for verifier generation)
- **Frameworks & Tools**: gnark, gnark-crypto, circom (migration experience), Geth, Hardhat, Docker
- **ZK Primitives**: PLONK, Groth16, recursive SNARKs, field arithmetics, hash-to-curve

## 🔗 Projects / Repositories I Contribute To

- [`celer-zk-bridge`](https://github.com/celer-network/celer-zk-bridge) – Cross-chain ZK messaging using gnark circuits.
- [`celer-gnark-circuits`](https://github.com/celer-network/celer-gnark-circuits) – Custom gnark-based circuits for message validation and state commitments.
- Internal tools for recursive proof generation, batching, and on-chain verification.
